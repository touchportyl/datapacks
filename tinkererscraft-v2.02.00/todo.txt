## using scheduling to run repeated functions:


execute as @e[blah] run schedule function [function] 1s

inside function is-

remove 1 from IRON score
add 1 to TEMP score
execute as @e if TEMP score is less than 9 schedule function [FUnction] 1s




automated item name shower

execute as @a at @s if entity @e[type=item,limit=1,sort=nearest,tag=!named,tag=!fuck,distance=..5] run tag @e[type=item,limit=1,sort=nearest,tag=!fuck,distance=..5] add fuck

execute as @a at @s if entity @e[type=item,limit=1,sort=nearest,tag=!named,tag=fuck,distance=..5] run data modify block 0 0 0 Text1 set value '{"selector":"@e[type=item,limit=1,sort=nearest,tag=!named,tag=fuck]"}'

execute as @a at @s run data modify entity @e[type=item,limit=1,sort=nearest,tag=!named,tag=fuck,distance=..5] CustomName set from block 0 0 0 Text1

custom npc pathing

-- step 1:
build the path at y=1 out of stairs
2 blocks at the ends
example: o>>>>>>>>>>>>o

-- step 2:
spawn on first block
idle timer 1..200

-- step 3:
when timer is up,
stop and reset timer
face stair direction
start teleporting forward in very small increments
check the block in front

if half step,
tp up half step properly

if stair,
tp up the stairs properly

if air,
check further down,
if second block down is a fluid,
end path early
else if second block down cannot be stood on or is a fluid,
end path early

-- step 4:
when path ends,
teleport until centered on block
teleport to center just in case
make code that is the reverse direction of this



--- custom pathfinding?

wait I can just set the nibba to face me and walk forward
only issue is it needs to propogate a path if it hits a wall
so in a radius it looks for the closest air block
would that do it?
then if after 50 blocks it hasn't found the target go to the second closest air block
and repeat











when build furnace, give everyone in 15 blocks range the build_smeltery achievement
