#> build (references: ../modules/smelting/detection)
# this code sorts items, some categories are inclusive of each other
# - cannot be smelted (tagged with TC_slag)
# - able to be smelted (tagged with TC_smelting and its item name)
# - able to start a reaction (tagged with its item name)
# - able to create a smeltery (tagged with TC_buildsmeltery)


# filter out items that will be building a smeltery
