# touchportyl's Datapacks
All of the developmental versions for datapacks created by [touchportyl](https:/github.com/touchportyl) can be found here. The builds here are usually unfinished and are not game ready.

There are 2 main branches, each at different levels of completion.
- master: Holds the latest release versions of everything.
- staging: Holds the newest seemingly working version. Bugs should be minimal, contains unfinished features and breaking changes.
New dev branches can be created from staging which holds everything from bugs to unfinished features.

There are 6 folders sorting all my code in various levels of progress.
- Released: Contains .zip files that are released publicly
- Ready for release: Working datapacks that are fully updated to the latest version
- Requires update: Working datapacks that requires an update
- Work in progress: Datapacks that are currently being worked on
- Concepts: Unfinished conceptual datapacks
- Archived: Old code for reference whenever needed
