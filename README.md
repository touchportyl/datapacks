# touchportyl's Datapacks
All of the developmental versions for datapacks created by [touchportyl](https:/github.com/touchportyl) can be found here. The builds here are usually unfinished and are not game ready.

There are 2 main branches, each at different levels of completion.
- master: Holds the latest release versions of everything.
- staging: Holds the newest seemingly working version. Bugs should be minimal, contains unfinished features and breaking changes.
New dev branches can be created from staging which holds everything from bugs to unfinished features.

There are 6 folders sorting all my code in various levels of progress.
- Released: Contains all the working datapacks that have been released publicly.
- Ready for release: Working datapacks that are fully updated to the latest version, but have not been released publicly yet.
- Requires update: Already working datapacks that requires an update to the latest version of Minecraft.
- Work in progress: Datapacks that don't work and are currently being worked on.
- Concepts: Unfinished conceptual datapacks in early stage testing.
- Archived: Old code for reference whenever needed.

A 7th non-numbered folder has been added for storing all distributables, aptly named "dist", which contains .zip files that are released publicly.
