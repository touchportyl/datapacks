#> version checker
# this code runs to check which version the game is running in
#
# it disables the datapack if the version is not supported, preventing advancements or anything to function and mess with the game in any way
# it also comes with the capability to target specific minecraft versions and only enable certain code for certain versions
# afaik this feature was invented by me, I have not seen anyone do this before
